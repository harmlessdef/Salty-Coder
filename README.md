# Salty-Coder

Hello ðŸ‘‹
Salty-Coder here.

My GitHub account was suspended with no warning, and not even an email of explaination.
I have set up a GitLab account and may need to use that in future.

It will be a shame to say goodbye to Github after ~6 years of contributions.
I have always attempted to contribute to this platform, with pull requests etc.

Hopefully I can get my account back, however I do not have much hope.
